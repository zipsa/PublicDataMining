1. all_data (It contains raw RPKM values and all stats I calculated)
2. significant_2fold_only (This contains genes that are up or down more than 2-fod “and” p value <0.01,
worthwhile to check them out)
3. manually_selected_genes (This contains our genes of interest and their genes including Tcf7, Bcl2 and zeb2.
Note that result value here was recapitulated in the paper)

Comments:
1. Notch pathways seems to be normal.
2. IL7R was suppressed in KO but Cxcr5 and Klrg1 is upregulated significantly.
3. Myb is cMyb. This was unexpectedly overexpressed in Myb KO cells. It seems like this was due to the original
targeting vector to generate Myb fl allele. It targets exon II of Myb but spare other exons. Therefore, the
detected signals likely from the transcript that does not produce functional Myb protein.
