## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r lollipop plot}
#Generating lollipop plot as an alternative to bar graph, using 274 significant genes identified from C4-CD8-LAYN genes

setwd("C:/Users/hjin02/Desktop/scRNAseq/results-analysis/selectgenes/") #Somehow you should directly 

c4 <- read.csv("lollipop-plot.csv", header=T) 
#Note: highlight categories were categorized based on a, b and c. If assigned by numbers, ggplot2 will recognize the category as continuous variables. 


library("ggpubr")

#Default
ggdotchart(c4, x = "GeneSymbol", y = "F",
           color = "highlight",                          # Color by groups
           palette = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"), # Custom color palette
           sorting = "ascending",                        # Sort value in descending order
           add = "segments",                             # Add segments from y = 0 to dots
           ggtheme = theme_pubr()                        # ggplot2 theme
           )


#Modification
ggdotchart(c4, x = "GeneSymbol", y = "F",
           color = "highlight",                          # Color by groups
           palette = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"),# Custom color palette
           dot.size = 2,
           sorting = "descending",                        # Sort value in descending order
           add = "segments",                             # Add segments from y = 0 to dots
           ggtheme = theme_pubr()                        # ggplot2 theme
           )





```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
